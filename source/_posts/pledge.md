<h2 class="center">Boyz II Men - My Pledge</h2>
<div class="center">
What is it to you if I told you
Everything that I ever made me think about you
Would you believe that all my smile
Cuz what I’m feeling I can never show you
You said you understand me
We come to find out I know it‘s really not true
And I never let you know when I’m tired
And my pride won’t let you know when I’m weak
If I told you everything that my soul couldn’t handle
It'd be pretty damn foolish of me
<!-- more -->
[Chorus]
So I’m trying harder
To show you how I’m feeling inside
And I’ll never desert you
Kinda hard to cry the tears that I hide
Don’t you worry beauty
I’ll be everything you want me to be
Set my pride aside for you
And I pledge all my love to thee
 
(Mike)
And I promise I’ll be true
(In the midnight long, how will you be there)
For the rest of the night
(For the rest of my life, can I stay with you)
And I promise I’ll be true
(Can I come with you all the time..)
For the rest of the night
(Can I come with you, always)
 
I sit alone with just a candle
Wondering how I planned to gain your trust
And my frustrations pass me by and I
Knowing that its the best thing for us
Oh I try to tell you on the phone
But I know I’d rather wait until you get home
 
And still I never let you know when I am tired
And my pride won’t let you know when I’m weak
If I can show you everything that my soul couldn’t handle
Would be pretty damn foolish of me
 
[Chorus x2]
</div>
